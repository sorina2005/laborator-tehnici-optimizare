## Project Overview
This repository serves as a professional portfolio of **MATLAB-centric** implementations focused on numerical analysis and computational mathematics. The project demonstrates the application of mathematical theory to solve complex linear systems and optimize data processing through high-level algorithmic scripts. Developed entirely within the **MATLAB/Octave ecosystem**, the codebase prioritizes numerical stability, matrix-based efficiency, and algorithmic precision.



## Core Technical Competencies

### 1. Matrix-Based Linear Solvers
Implementation of fundamental and advanced algorithms for solving systems of linear equations using MATLAB's optimized matrix handling:
* **Direct Methods**: Robust implementation of the **Gaussian Elimination** algorithm, designed for solving dense linear systems with a focus on partial pivoting and numerical accuracy.
* **Iterative Algorithms**: Implementation of the **Jacobi** and **Gauss-Seidel** methods. These scripts utilize iterative logic to approximate solutions for large-scale systems, incorporating convergence criteria and error tolerance monitoring.
